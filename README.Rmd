# fluidSCqpcr

Package to pre-process, analyze and visualize single-cell qPCR data. Developed to be used with Fluidigm C1 - Biomark data, but can also be used with other kind of data. This is the first raw version and has not yet been extensively tested. In the future I will try to couple it with other more advanced analysis methods and packages, such as monocle, mast and sincell.

## Usage
